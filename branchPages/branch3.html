        <p class="info">Since in order to get to this page, the user has to click on a blossom on the chokecherry tree made from scars, this page is supposed to be the user entering Sethe's bloodstream. That is why there is a bloody theme on this page. As for the tree in the bottom-right corner, the tree fits the motif of the chokecherry tree in the book. There is also a crow perched on a branch which is symbolic of all the death in the book such as the death's of Sethe's daughter, Baby Suggs and Halle.</p>  
        <p class="info">The last 2 details on this page are the platelets and white blood cells. The platelets (the purple things) are there since the platelets in the blood are what initiate blood clotting and in order for Sethe's scars to close, platelets are needed. As for the white blood cells, they fight off infections and they represent how even though Sethe had to suffer through so much, she is still fighting, just like how the white blood cells are still fighitng off infections to protect her. </p>
