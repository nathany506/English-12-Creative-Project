        <p class="info">In beloved the "tobacco tin [is] buried deep in his chest where a red heart used to be" (pg. 36). This tobacco tin is symbolic of all of his past trauma that he chose to seal inside of himself and as a result, the tobacco result is sealed to begin with on this website, and can only be opened by prying it open multiple times. It's similar to how in the book Paul D's tobacco is slowly pried open and some of his past trauma's escape. The tobacco box is also rusted since "[the tobacco tin] was rusted shut" (pg. 58). As for the black man himself, Paul D should be around 50 years of age when the story takes place, however, I couldn't find a good picture of a 50 year old black man's torso anywhere. Paul D's skintone is also described as having "peachstone skin" and I think the person's skin colour on the website is similar to that colour (pg. 3).  </p> 
        <p class="info">As for the background and the chain, the chain represents that even though he sealed away his past trauma and cast away the chains of being a slave, he is still shackled albeit to a lesser extent since his past trauma's still come back to haunt him a bit in the story. This is represented by the chain as the chain isn't actually connected to anything but it's still there weighing him down. As for the background, it is a muddy forest with heavy rain which is where Paul D is able to escape from his owners with his bretheren. Also there is no feature to go back to the tobacco tin page, as once the tobacco tin is opened, it cannot be reclosed easily.</p>
