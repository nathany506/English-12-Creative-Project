        <h3 class="heading3">Chokecherry Tree Page Design</h3>
        <p class="info">This page is heavily inspired by Sethe's story and life journey. The women on this page is supposed to be Sethe. Her back contains "A chokecherry tree" pattern of scars as a result of her getting whipped before her departure of Sweet Home (pg. 39). These scars are physical and permanent reminders of the cruelty of slavery, and yet it still eerily resembles a chokecherry tree, something that is beautiful and alive. It shows how new life can rise from even the darkess corners.</p>
        <p class="info">As for the background, the 4 images that I chose focus on different aspects of Sethe's life. The one in the top-right corner is the Ohio River. It is the place where Sethe's daughter Denver was born. Although it may seem like a happy moment, birthing her daughter, it is masked by sadness as Sethe at this point was near death and starving and was only able to survive by the help of the "whitegirl" Amy (pg. 44). The one in the top-left is a cornfield and it was in a cornfield that Sethe and her husband Halle have sex, which again may seem like a happy moment, but it is again masked by sadness as at this point they are still slaves. In the bottom-left it is an image of an old run down house, symbolic of the house where Sethe lives house 124. Although Sethe may have her very own house which is great considering the fact she came from nothing, it is very lonely as no one visits due to it being haunted by the ghost of the daughter she murdered. Finally, in the bottom-right it is a picture of a dying woman in a bed with a man next to her. This alludes to Sethe at the end of the book, after Beloved leaves and she choses to lay in bed and wait to die believing that she had lost her "best thing" (pg. 135). However, Paul D comes to her bedside in order to tell her that "You your best thing Sethe" (pg. 136). These 4 scenes from the book are all masked in sadness and that is why there is a filter that decreases the saturation and lightness of all the images, making the images monotone and dull.</p>
